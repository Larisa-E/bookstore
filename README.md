# bookstore

The use of the .NET Framework and the MySql.Data library ensures a responsive user interface with a clear separation of responsibilities across different forms for order management, customer administration, and book inventory, including CRUD operations.

This project is a Windows Forms application for managing a bookstore with separate forms for books, customers, and orders. It uses a MySQL database for permanent storage with a helper class to streamline database access. Each form handles a specific domain, while shared tools and configuration are centralized for easy management.

The online bookstore's database application is a user-friendly and efficient software solution. By using .NET and MySQL, the project ensures that it is easy to maintain and update. The clear functional separation makes it easy to add new features in the future, allowing it to adapt to user needs.
